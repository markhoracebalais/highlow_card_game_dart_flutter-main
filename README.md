HIGH LOW CARD GAME
Create an app that implements a high-low card game with the following specs:

1. A card is shown and the player has to guess if the next card is >= or < the current card.
2. Aces are considered to have a value of 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13
3. The app should display the last 5 cards guessed by the user
4. If the user guesses correctly, they get points. If they guess wrong, the game ends and the user gets notified
